I'm currently a first year master student at [Penn Engineering](https://www.seas.upenn.edu). I'm also a researcher at the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Nadia Figueroa](https://nbfigueroa.github.io/). Previously, I received my bachelor degree in Measurement and Control Technology and Instruments from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Yuan Yang](https://ins.seu.edu.cn/yy2/list.htm).

My research interests encompass Control Theory, Robot Learning, Human-Robot Interaction, and Task/Motion Planning.
